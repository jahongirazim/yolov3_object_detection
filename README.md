# yolov3_object_detection
We learn how to install YOLOv3 (You Look Only Once) Object Detection algorithm. Next we will detect object 80 types objects from image (and also image path), multiple images (and image paths lists), video files. We will be using Google's Colaboratory high performance computing environment.
